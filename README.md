<h1>UQ Extend Customisations</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains customisations for UQ's Extend Platform. This platform is UQ's version of Open EdX, and allows for external references to be incorporated into the platform to improve functionality. To take full advantage of this feature this repository creates JS and CSS files that can be referenced, as well as applications that interpret and apply these references within Extend.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Bootstrap Design Library</h3>
<p>The Bootstrap Content Delivery Network (CDN) allows developers to link directly to Bootstrap's Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS) files hosted on high-performance servers, enhancing website loading speed. This service minimizes the need for developers to host these files locally, reducing server load and improving overall website performance. </p>
<p><strong>In simple terms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You write content on a website (or Extend in this case) and it is converted into HTML.</li>
  <li>CSS determines how the HTML is formatted on the page (position, colour, size etc.)</li>
  <li>JS determines what happens when the page or the user takes certain actions within the HTML (before page loads, page is loading, finished loading, or the user scrolls, clicks, hovers).</li>
  <li>Bootstrap is a library (collection) of common styles and actions that we can reference in the HTML to make it do certain things, or look a certain way, rather than having to write the JS or CSS from scratch.</li>
  <li>It's build by Twitter, and has been taken and modified by multiple other large corporations, so the look and feel (the outcome of your code), will likely strike you as similar to many other websites you encounter on the web.</li>
</ul>
<h3>FontAwesome Icon Library</h3>
<p>Iconography is a subtle mnemonic tool that you see and are led by in millions of interactions online that you likely don't think much about. Extend actually uses part of the Font Awesome Library already. We are in this repository creating the full access to Font Awesome Version 6 free library, rather than the partial Font Awesome Version 4 or 5 library Extend has in it's base backend code.</p>
